## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtainded from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States).

We are going to use the following library:

```{r library, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

And load the data we already wrangled:

```{r loaded data}

load("rda/murders.rda")

```

## Murder rate by state

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state

```{r barplot murder rate, echo=FALSE}
murders%>%
  mutate(abb=reorder(abb, rate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate))+
  geom_bar(width=0.5, stat="identity", color="Black")+
  coord_flip()
```
